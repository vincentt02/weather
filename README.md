Weather app made in react that uses OpenWeather's Weather API to fetch current weather data. <br />

The app makes 2 api requests when getting weather data. The first one calls OpenWeather's Geocoder API to return a list of locations for the user to pick from when entering a city. Once the user picks a city the app calls OpenWeather's Current weather data API to fetch the weather data for the corresponding choice. <br />

Axios was used for api requests. <br />

The api key was removed from the version uploaded to github.
